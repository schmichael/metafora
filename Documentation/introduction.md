## Introduction

Metafora is a framework for creating highly available and distributed services
written in Go.  Metafora is embeded meaning your code controls how and when
metafora is started.  It uses etcd to coordinate across the nodes in your
cluster.  Metafora is a leaderless task distribution system where the nodes
coordinate with each other to ensure that work is evenly distributed over the
cluster.

Metafora is an embedded work stealing framework built on top of etcd.

## Overview

Metafora gives you the ablity to build an elastic distributed application.  It
makes it easy to build applications that scale in or out, and that can recover
from node failures.  The following diagrams are examples of how this works.

#### Node failure or scaling in

When a node fails (or you scale in your nodes), metafora will will release the
tasks from the missing node back into the task pool.  Other metafora nodes will
detect the unclaimed tasks and attempt to claim them.  It's important to note
that metafora simply manages the reassigment of tasks, its up to your code
(possibly in your metafora handler) to cleanup any bad state caused by a tasks
crashing during processing.

#### Node recovery or scaling out

When a new node joins the cluster it begins picking up new tasks immediately.
Initially the other nodes may have more tasks because they've been in the
cluster longer.  To address this, occasionally the members compare task load
and rebalance the tasks between them.

Balancing logic is controlled by the Balancer implementation you pass to the
Consumer.
